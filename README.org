Make use of an empty echo area to display useful messages!

Code for this package is extracted from the package [[https://github.com/zk-phi/symon][symon]] (equipping
your echo area with a system monitor!), so that other features may
make use of the echo area.

If you have an interesting function to offer, please file a pull
request for inclusion in =echo-sth-examples.el=!
